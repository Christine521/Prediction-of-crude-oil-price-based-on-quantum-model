# Prediction-of-crude-oil-price-based-on-quantum-model
This paper constructs a quantum model to solve the problem of international crude oil
market price prediction. The price movement in the market is compared with the movement of particles in the micro world, and the probability of its existence is calculated by quantum mechanics algorithm. In the process of calculation, fuzzy mathematics and spectrum filtering are used to process the original data. Then the volatility function is introduced to describe the market energy. According  to the simultaneous equation of market energy, the existence probability and transition orbit of market  price in the future are solved. Finally, on the basis of the probability of price existence and transition orbit, the future price path is predicted. In addition, this paper also designs a practical trading strategy, the actual results show that the model can achieve good results, and provide reference and guidance for individual, institutional and corporate investors. The innovation of the research work in this paper is that the price movement is compared to the particle movement, the market price transition phenomenon is calculated by quantum mechanics algorithm, and the consistency of micro and macro is unified in the model.
